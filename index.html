	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>A car or automobile is a wheeled, self-powered motor vehicle used for transportation and a product of the automotive industry. Most definitions of the term specify that cars are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels with tyres, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car. In that year, German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the United States of America, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.</p>

	<p>This is my favourite car!!!</p>
	<p>The Koenigsegg Regera combines a powerful twin-turbo V8 combustion engine with three electric motors and cutting edge battery power via new powertrain technology called Koenigsegg Direct Drive. This revolutionary technology removes the traditional gearbox, making the car lighter and more efficient. While traditional Koenigseggs have always had surprising levels of practicality, creature comforts and features, our primary focus has always been to make the fastest cars on the planet – around a racetrack or anywhere else. The Koenigsegg Regera continues this tradition, but with innovative technology that blends outrageous speed, supreme comfort, and a unique Direct Drive experience.
	Regera is Swedish for “to Reign” – a suitable name for a machine that offers an unforeseen combination of power, responsiveness and luxury. The Regera will reign as king of the open road – the fastest accelerating, most powerful production car ever.
	In spite of all its advanced technology and creature comforts, the Regera is comparatively light and can still perform competitively around a race circuit. How does 3.2 seconds between 150 to 250 km/h and under 20 seconds from 0 to 400 km/h sound? The only Hypercar/Megacar that we think could possibly be faster around a circuit is another Koenigsegg.
	The Regera is to be handcrafted in an edition of just 80 vehicles at Koenigsegg’s production facility in Ängelholm, Sweden. This is the first time ever that Koenigsegg will have two different models in parallel production.</p>
